We've just locked the survey for 2018, and created the [2019 Canadian Information Security Survey][2019survey].
Follow the link and complete the survey!

### Data Analysis

The 2018 data lives at [github.com/infosecsurvey/survey-data/2018][2018data].
There are a few rows that need to be migrated to the 2019 result sets(which
didn't exist before cloning the survey for 2019). Feel free to check the data or
commit log to verify the changes have occurred.
