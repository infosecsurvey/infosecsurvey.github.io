# About

This project stated in January of 2018 in response to the lack of good salary
data for information security professionals in Canada.

## Why this is important

Most sites that gather data salaries are very US-centric, and often lack data
around more specific data that allows for better analysis. The goal is to be
able to provide data, and analysis, that helps to empower information security
professionals to be better equipped to evaluate the job market and offer
letters.
